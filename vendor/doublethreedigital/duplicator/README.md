## Duplicator

<!-- /statamic:hide -->

Duplicator makes it seamlessly for content editors to duplicate entries, terms, assets & forms from inside the Statamic Control Panel.

If you want to learn how Duplicator works under the hood, I've written [a blog post just for you](https://duncanmcclean.com/under-the-hood-of-the-duplicator-addon?ref=duplicator-readme).

## Installation

First, require Duplicator as a Composer dependency:

```
composer require doublethreedigital/duplicator
```

Optionally, you may publish Duplicator's configuration file:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="duplicator-config"
```

Now you can start duplicating!

## Documentation

Read the documentation over on the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/addons/double-three-digital/duplicator/docs).

## Sponsor Duncan

This addon is open-source, meaning anyone can use this addon in their sites for **free**!

However, maintaining and developing new features for open-source projects can take quite a bit of time. If you're using Duplicator in your production environment, please [consider sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/duncanmcclean) (Duncan McClean) for a couple dollars a month.

## Security

Only the latest version of Duplicator (v2.0) will receive security updates if a vulnerability is found.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to Duncan straight away, [via email](mailto:security@doublethree.digital). Please don't report security issues through GitHub Issues.
